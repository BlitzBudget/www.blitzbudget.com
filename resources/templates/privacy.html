                <p>At BlitzBudget, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. Every company has a privacy policy, but when it comes right down to it, we want you to understand how we protect your privacy and to know what data we collect and how we use it. So let’s get to it.</p>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This policy describes the types of information BlitzBudget (“BlitzBudget”, “Company” or “We”) may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit and utilize the financial planning software available through our apps, software, and the website <a href="https://www.blitzbudget.com">blitzbudget.com</a> (collectively, our “Website“). This includes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information and the basis for doing so.</p>
                <p>This policy applies to information we collect on the Website, in e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and this Website and, through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website or other services (such as the iOS App Store or Google Play Store), which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and this Website.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time by giving notice on this page and/or within this Application and/or sending a notice to you via any contact information available to us. It is strongly recommended to check this page often, referring to the date of the last modification listed at the top.</p>
                <h2>Collection and Use of Personal Data</h2>
                <p>BlitzBudget relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Generally, this includes analytics, user database management, managing support and contact requests, transaction aggregation, hosting and backend infrastructure and infrastructure monitoring.</p>
                <p>We process data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>in order to provide the services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the <a href="https://www.blitzbudget.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. For example, we cannot provide our services without an email address to sign into your account, conduct customer support, or send educational materials; we cannot provide the service without users providing financial information on which a budget or a goal is based;</li>
                    <li>where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;</li>
                    <li>to protect your vital interests, or those of others, such as in the case of emergencies;</li>
                    <li>where you have made the information public;</li>
                    <li>where necessary in the public interest;</li>
                    <li>where necessary for the purposes of BlitzBudget’s or a third party’s legitimate interests, such as those of visitors, members or partners;</li>
                    <li>where you provide consent (for example, to join email mailing lists).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We also process your data based on our legitimate interest in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>providing a quality service and in improving that service;</li>
                    <li>ensuring the services are secure;</li>
                    <li>protection against fraud, spam and abuse, etc.;</li>
                    <li>understanding how clients and visitors interact with our websites and services, so that we can continuously improve the experience and effectiveness of doing so.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Categories of data we collect</h3>
                <p>We collect information about you, including information that directly or indirectly identifies you, through your use of BlitzBudget. We do so:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>when you provide the information, through filling out forms or otherwise providing information on our websites and apps;</li>
                    <li>when we connect to your financial institutions in order to retrieve transaction data on your behalf;</li>
                    <li>when you use location services to record transactions in our mobile apps;</li>
                    <li>when you correspond with us to receive customer support via email or chat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your email address that you provide to us as a username, or that is provided to us by your social media account(s) if you use those for sign-in.</li>
                    <li>Your IP address when you interact with our website and apps.</li>
                    <li>When you chose to directly link financial accounts to BlitzBudget, your login credentials (including usernames and passwords) for the accounts you link to our services, account security and/or challenge questions for those accounts, and other information from the financial accounts that you link to our service (including account balances, transactions and holdings).</li>
                    <li>Your location when you record a transaction in our mobile applications and have previously activated location services.</li>
                    <li>Records and copies of your correspondence (including e-mail addresses different than that used to establish your account), if you contact us.</li>
                    <li>Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.</li>
                    <li>Details of transactions you carry out through our Website and of the fulfillment of your orders. You may be required to provide financial information before placing an order through our Website.</li>
                    <li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Website. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our Website, subscribing to our service, or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our Website.</li>
                    <li>To provide you with customer support or service offerings, including responding to and resolving your inquiries and requests via email or text-based chat. When you request assistance from our customer support team with respect to importing third-party financial account data, to allow a customer support representative to review a limited amount of data from recent transactions for the sole purpose of facilitating technical implementation of the account aggregation services. When asked to do so by you, our customer support representative may utilize that transaction data on your behalf in interactions with third-party financial account providers intended to facilitate implementation of requested account aggregation within our services.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Cookies &amp; technical data</h4>
                <p>BlitzBudget collects information as visitors and clients browse and interact with the website and/or apps.</p>
                <h5>Site visitors</h5>
                <p>When you visit our website, we may place a cookie on your browser so that our system can recognize you when you make a return visit. Third parties may also place cookies on your browser for targeted advertising purposes. That cookie allows us to recognize your browser on a return visit. We do not otherwise collect or process data when you are a Visitor.</p>
                <h5>Signed-in Users</h5>
                <p>To help analyze how you and other visitors navigate BlitzBudget websites and applications, and compile aggregate statistics about site usage and response rates, we, with assistance from third-party analytics service providers (described below), collect certain information when you visit our site. This information includes IP address, geographic location of the device, browser type, browser language, date and time of your request, time(s) of your visit(s), page views and page elements (e.g., links) that you click, and other similar data. We may use cookies, pixel tags, and tracking scripts on our site or in our email messages to assist us in collecting and analyzing such information. We use this information to provide better, more relevant content on our site, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements, to identify and fix problems, and to improve your overall experience on our site.</p>
                <h5>Opting out of Cookies</h5>
                <p>There are a number ways to limit the cookies that your browser accepts or limit the way in which they’re used.</p>
                <p>One way to limit cookies is by opting out of third party cookies/advertising networks, like <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics</a>. If you are in Canada or the EU you can use the <a href="https://youradchoices.ca">DAAC’s youradchoices.ca</a>, or <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/">EDAA’s youronlinechoices.eu</a> respectively. Some people use what are called “Ad Blockers” to limit advertising/tracking. We don’t endorse any <em>particular</em> Ad Blocker, but want you to know that it’s an option since you’re reading this and are likely quite privacy-minded.</p>
                <p>Opting out of cookies using the above methods likely won’t cause problems with our services per se, but it makes it harder for us to spend our advertising budget effectively because we won’t know how you discovered BlitzBudget and sometimes won’t even know if you’re already a customer of ours. Among other things, that means we might embarrass ourselves by showing you the same advertisement even if you are already a fan. Depending on the services you block, it might also make it harder for us to know how you’re using our apps, or know if you’re running into problems.</p>
                <p>Another way of limiting cookies is by controlling cookies in your web browser’s settings. (Disabling cookies in this way is more likely to actually break or worsen the experience when using some of our services).<br>
