                    At BlitzBudget, we respect your privacy and are committed to
                    protecting it. Every company has a privacy policy, but when
                    it comes right down to it, we want you to understand how we
                    protect your privacy and to know what data we collect and
                    how we use it. So let’s get to it.

                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>
                    This policy describes the types of information BlitzBudget
                    (“BlitzBudget”, “Company” or “We”) may collect from you or

                    (collectively, our “Website“). This includes our practices
                    for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and
                    disclosing that information and the basis for doing so.

                  <p>
                    This policy applies to information we collect on the

                    BlitzBudget relies on a number of legal bases to collect,
                    use, share, and otherwise process the information we have
                    about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
                    Generally, this includes analytics, user database
                    management, managing support and contact requests,
                    transaction aggregation, hosting and backend infrastructure
                    and infrastructure monitoring.
                  </p>
                  <p>We process data:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      in order to provide the services and fulfill our

                      email address to sign into your account, conduct customer
                      support, or send educational materials; we cannot provide
                      the service without users providing financial information
                      on which a budget or a goal is based;

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      where necessary for the purposes of BlitzBudget’s or a

                    <li>
                      understanding how clients and visitors interact with our

                      To provide you with customer support or service offerings,
                      including responding to and resolving your inquiries and
                      requests via email or text-based chat. When you request
                      assistance from our customer support team with respect to
                      importing third-party financial account data, to allow a
                      customer support representative to review a limited amount
                      of data from recent transactions for the sole purpose of
                      facilitating technical implementation of the account
                      aggregation services. When asked to do so by you, our
                      customer support representative may utilize that
                      transaction data on your behalf in interactions with
                      third-party financial account providers intended to
                      facilitate implementation of requested account aggregation
                      within our services.

                  <h4>Cookies &amp; technical data</h4>
                  <p>
                    BlitzBudget collects information as visitors and clients
                    browse and interact with the website and/or apps.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Site visitors</h5>
                  <p>
                    When you visit our website, we may place a cookie on your
                    browser so that our system can recognize you when you make a
                    return visit. Third parties may also place cookies on your
                    browser for targeted advertising purposes. That cookie
                    allows us to recognize your browser on a return visit. We do
                    not otherwise collect or process data when you are a
                    Visitor.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Signed-in Users</h5>
                  <p>
                    To help analyze how you and other visitors navigate
                    BlitzBudget websites and applications, and compile aggregate
                    statistics about site usage and response rates, we, with
                    assistance from third-party analytics service providers
                    (described below), collect certain information when you
                    visit our site. This information includes IP address,
                    geographic location of the device, browser type, browser
                    language, date and time of your request, time(s) of your
                    visit(s), page views and page elements (e.g., links) that
                    you click, and other similar data. We may use cookies, pixel
                    tags, and tracking scripts on our site or in our email
                    messages to assist us in collecting and analyzing such
                    information. We use this information to provide better, more
                    relevant content on our site, to measure the effectiveness
                    of advertisements, to identify and fix problems, and to
                    improve your overall experience on our site.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Opting out of Cookies</h5>
                  <p>
                    There are a number ways to limit the cookies that your
                    browser accepts or limit the way in which they’re used.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One way to limit cookies is by opting out of third party
                    cookies/advertising networks, like
                    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
                      >Google Analytics</a
                    >. If you are in Canada or the EU you can use the
                    <a href="https://youradchoices.ca"
                      >DAAC’s youradchoices.ca</a
                    >, or
                    <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/"
                      >EDAA’s youronlinechoices.eu</a
                    >
                    respectively. Some people use what are called “Ad Blockers”
                    to limit advertising/tracking. We don’t endorse any
                    <em>particular</em> Ad Blocker, but want you to know that
                    it’s an option since you’re reading this and are likely
                    quite privacy-minded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Opting out of cookies using the above methods likely won’t
                    cause problems with our services per se, but it makes it
                    harder for us to spend our advertising budget effectively
                    because we won’t know how you discovered BlitzBudget and
                    sometimes won’t even know if you’re already a customer of
                    ours. Among other things, that means we might embarrass
                    ourselves by showing you the same advertisement even if you
                    are already a fan. Depending on the services you block, it
                    might also make it harder for us to know how you’re using
                    our apps, or know if you’re running into problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another way of limiting cookies is by controlling cookies in
                    your web browser’s settings. (Disabling cookies in this way
                    is more likely to actually break or worsen the experience

                  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
                  <p>
                    We retain account data for a period of time after an account
                    expires, whether through trial expiration or subscription
                    expiration, unless you delete your account as described

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once an account has become inactive beyond the period of
                    time described below, we will delete its budget, goals or
                    transactions data (Keep in mind that if you cancel your
                    account, it remains active until the end of your
                    subscription. The timeline below doesn’t start until that
                    subscription expires.)

                  <p>
                    After deletion, we retain your email address in order to be
                    able to confirm deletion of associated data.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Automated data processing</h3>
                  <p>
                    In conjunction with a third-party payment processor, we use
                    automated analysis to screen for suspicious or fraudulent
                    transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we make solely automated decisions that affect you in a
                    legal or a significant way, you have the right to provide

                    member of our staff.
